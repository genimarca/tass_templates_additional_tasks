                  each individual item was converted to a plain text document, and some further post-processing is applied
                  to remove unwanted sentences, such as headers, footers and similar elements, and to flatten HTML lists
                  into plain sentences. The final documents are manually tagged using Brat by a group of annotators. After
                  tagging, a post-processing was applied to Brat&rsquo;s output files (ANN format) to obtain the output files
