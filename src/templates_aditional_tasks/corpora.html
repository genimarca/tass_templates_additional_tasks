            <p class="c31">An additional <strong>285</strong> sentences are included in the
              <i>develop</i> folder. These sentences are also fully tagged, and are meant to be used for model selection and parameter
              tunning. We encourage participants to try different models, algorithms, and parameter settings. Each of these
              different variants should be trained on the
              <strong>training corpus</strong> only, and then their performance measured on the
              <strong>development corpus</strong>, to select the best variant. This separation ensures first a fair comparison among
              participants. Furthermore, comparting different models on a development corpus, independent from the training
              corpus, also helps reducing the risk of overfitting, and will give you a more accurate estimate of the actual
              performance of your models.</p>
