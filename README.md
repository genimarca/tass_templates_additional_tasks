#TASS Templeates for web pages of additional tasks

This project is a template for the webpages of the additional tasks of
**[TASS-2018](http://www.sepln.org/workshops/tass/2018/)**.

The aim of the organization of TASS is to ease the development of the
web site of each additional task to their organizers. Besides, the
organization of TASS wants to keep a similar style among the web sites
of the different tasks.

The content of the project is:

*   css: It contains the css style files of the project. The main file is
tass_2017.css, and the other ones are auxiliary files. The canvas of the
page follows a grid schema, which is defined in tass_2017.css.
*   images: The images folder. It contains the image of TASS.
*	index.html: The main file of the web site of the task.


Each task has its own folder, and the responsible person of the development
of the website has to put in contact with Eugenio Martínez Cámara
<emcamara at decsai dot ugr dot es> in order to ask for the privileges to
modify the repository.
